**kubedash** is a terminal-based Kubernetes dashboard that provides a simple and interactive way to manage Kubernetes resources directly from the command line. It allows you to list, search, describe, and delete resources with ease. Built with Go using the `tview`, `cobra`, and `logrus` libraries, kubedash offers a clean, user-friendly terminal interface for Kubernetes management.

## Features

- **List Resources**: Quickly list Kubernetes resources such as Pods, Deployments, ReplicaSets, and more.
- **Search Resources**: Easily search for resources across your clusters using simple queries.
- **Describe Resources**: View detailed information about a resource to better understand its configuration and status.
- **Delete Resources**: Delete Kubernetes resources from the command line with simple actions.
- **Customizable**: Configure the tool to suit your preferences with simple flags and settings.

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: kubedash is built using Go 1.18+.
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: You need access to a running Kubernetes cluster (local or remote) with valid `kubectl` credentials.
- **Libraries**: This tool relies on the following Go libraries:
  - `tview`: For the terminal UI.
  - `cobra`: For command-line argument parsing and creating commands.
  - `logrus`: For structured logging.
